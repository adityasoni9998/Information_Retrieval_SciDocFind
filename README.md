#Abstract
We propose an end-to-end approach for faceted scientific paper retrieval that employs the SciRepEval dataset and pre-trained language models fine-tuned with contrastive loss using triples generated from the Highly Influential Citations dataset. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance across different facets of the CSFCube dataset and competitive performance in other facets, addressing the limitations of previous methods.
